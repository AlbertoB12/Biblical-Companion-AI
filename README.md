# üìñ Biblical Companion AI - Your AI Guide to Christian Faith üïäÔ∏è

This project provides an interactive AI experience for engaging with the Bible and Christian spirituality from Catholic, Orthodox Christian, and Protestant traditions. It leverages large language models and LangChain, with RAG and a QDrant vector database, to offer personalized guidance, prayer support, virtual confession (for Catholic and Orthodox users), and tailored meditation scripts based on user input and the specific Christian perspective chosen.

The idea for this project arose from the desire to create an accessible and informative tool for individuals seeking deeper understanding, comfort, and spiritual growth within their chosen Christian faith. By grounding responses in biblical text and adhering to the distinct values of each tradition, Biblical Companion AI aims to offer a respectful and insightful experience.
